# 👋Hi
**colored-tiles** is another project I created **2022**. I wanted to experiment with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/), so I created a grid with different colors.
Although the finished result lacks color and instead consists of shades of gray, it was still a lot of fun to play around with.

Here's an example: [Open Visual](https://hafithecat.github.io/a-frame-colored-tiles/).

# 📔 Usage
`npm install`

`npm run start`

# ❗
When running locally, the imports from `/components/` may need to be modified in the `index.html` file.

Because the github-pages site is hosted under a route rather than the root.
